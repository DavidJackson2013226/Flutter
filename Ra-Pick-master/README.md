# Ra-Pick

Ra-Pick is a ridesharing app designed to prioritize user safety and comfort, with a focus on addressing the concerns of marginalized identities. This app aims to provide a secure and inclusive environment for both riders and drivers, ensuring that all backgrounds are represented and accounted for. With features like real-time tracking, driver selection based on identity and personality traits, and user feedback, Ra-Pick aims to create a ridesharing experience that promotes safety and peace of mind.

## What it does

Ra-Pick functions similarly to other ridesharing apps, but with added features to enhance safety and comfort. Here are some key features:

1. **Alert for deviating drivers**: The app includes a feature that alerts users if their selected driver deviates from the designated route. Users are prompted to call emergency services if they feel unsafe due to the driver's actions.

2. **Dynamic user location**: Recognizing safety concerns while waiting for a rideshare, users have the option to select a feature that allows them to walk around while waiting for their driver. The app dynamically updates the driver with the user's location.

3. **Driver selection based on identity and personality**: When selecting a destination, users can choose from a selection of three drivers. The app provides details about the drivers' identity and personality traits, empowering riders to select drivers they feel most comfortable with.

4. **Post-trip feedback and ratings**: After each trip, users can provide feedback and rate drivers based on aspects such as cleanliness, safe driving, and comfort level. The app utilizes this feedback to suggest highly-rated drivers to users with similar preferences.

## How we built it

Ra-Pick was developed using the following technologies and tools:

- Flutter and Dart: We utilized Flutter, a UI toolkit, and the Dart programming language for app development. Flutter allowed us to create a cross-platform app with a consistent user experience on Android and iOS.

- Android Studio: We used Android Studio as our primary development environment for Flutter and Dart, enabling us to write code, debug, and build the app.

- Google JavaScript Map API: The app integrates the Google JavaScript Map API to display maps for users when selecting destinations and to track their own location.

- Firebase: We used Firebase for storing information and user authentication, ensuring secure data management.

- DocuSign: For driver-related processes, we incorporated DocuSign to enable drivers to sign preliminary documents electronically.

- OpenXC: We leveraged OpenXC to calculate driver behavior, including safe driving practices and adherence to speed limit
## Challenges we ran into

During the development process, we encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Familiarity with Android Studio and Flutter**: As we started using Flutter and Dart, we had to familiarize ourselves with the framework and its development workflow. We faced some learning curves, but ultimately it allowed us to build a powerful and efficient app.

2. **Real-time tracking implementation**: Implementing real-time tracking of the driver's location and dynamically updating the user's location on the map required extensive integration of APIs and handling location data efficiently. We had to overcome technical hurdles to ensure smooth and accurate tracking.
3. **Ensuring data privacy and security**: Given the sensitive nature of personal information and user data, we invested significant effort in implementing robust data privacy and security measures. We had to ensure that user information was securely stored and transmitted, following industry best practices and compliance requirements.

## What's next for Ra-Pick

In the future, we plan to expand Ra-Pick's features to further enhance driver comfort and satisfaction. Additionally, we aim to integrate Amadeus travel APIs to provide additional functionalities related to travel and transportation. With continuous improvements, Ra-Pick strives to be a leading ridesharing app that prioritizes safety, inclusivity, and user satisfaction.
